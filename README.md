# [benoit.jehanno.net](http://benoit.jehanno.net)

This project was generated with **vue-cli** (It was previously done with ng-cli but the overhead of angular was way too big so when I got webpack issues for the 3rd times coming back to the project and realized I had giga-tonnes of node_modules I switched ðŸ‘‹)
